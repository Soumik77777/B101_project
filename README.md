# B101 Project

We had a fun project in our B101 course at niser, where we had to come up with some new ideas in any field of biology. The diverse team included people from all of mainstream basic sciences and we really enjoyed presenting our ideas on treating atherosclerotic diseases.

# YouTube
We would really appreciate if you give [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pelF8mfoxLQ&ab_channel=SoumikBhattacharyya){:target="_blank"} a quick watch and let us know what you think!

# Why do i have a GitHub repo for that?
Because we also provided a quick health report and your BMI on the spot!
